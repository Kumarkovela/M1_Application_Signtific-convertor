# Introduction
## Unit Converter 
It makes conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors.
## Conversion Factor
It is used to change the units of a measured quatity without changeing its value.


The process of conversion depends on the specfic situation and the intended purpose. This may be governed by regulation, contract, technical specfications or other published standards. Engineering judgement may include such factors as:
  - The precision and accuracy of measurement and the associated uncertainty of measurement.
  - The statistical confidence interval or tolerance interval of the initial measurement.
  - The number of significant figures of the measurement.
  - The intended use of the measurement including the engineering tolerances.
  - Historical definitions of the units and their derivatives used in old measurements; e.g., International foot vs. US survey foot.

## Who
Unit converters are used by those who require quantites in a desired form of units for analytics of a system and is 
commonly used by students,enginers and many more.
## What
unit convertor makes conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity.
## When
when using measuring quantites,because units allow people to communicate amount uniformly in a way that can be
understood by others.
## Why
Because conversion are such an important part of problem,and you have to keep track of them so carefully,there's a
systematic way of handling conversions.
## How
Trough multiplications conversion factors.a conversion factor is used to change the units of a measured quantity without
changing its value.
## High Level Requirements
accuracy,
precision,
memory.
## Low Level Requirements
mass
